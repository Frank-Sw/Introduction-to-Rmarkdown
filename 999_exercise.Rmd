# Exercise

- Create an Rmd for HTML.
- Change some configuration options. For example, choose a theme or add a table of contents.
- Add a chunk that does some statistical calculation.
- Add a chunk that produces a visualization.  Align it with the `fig.align` chunk option.
- Add a chunk similar to the previous but have the document not show the code, just the output.
- Now Add a chunk that *only* shows the code, but doesn't actually run.
- Add a chunk that creates an R object such as a set of numbers or text. Then use that object in the text via inline R code.
- Italicize or bold some words.
- Add a line break via HTML. Bonus: use <span class="pack">htmltools</span> and the `br()` function to add a line break from an R chunk.  See what happens when you simply put several line returns.
- Set an option that will be applied to the whole document.


## More

For these, you'll have to look it up, as I haven't explicitly discussed it.

- Create a quoted block.
- Add a subtitle to your document
- Remove the # from the R outputs


## Advanced

For this you'd have to know a little CSS, but just doing it once will go quite a ways to helping you feel comfortable being creative with your own CSS files.

- Create a *.css file to set an option for your link color. Don't forget to refer to it in you YAML.
- Create a special class of links and add a link of that class.
