# Exercise

- Create an Rmd for HTML.
- Change some options. For example, choose a theme or add a table of contents.
- Add a chunk that does some statistical calculation
- Add a chunk that produces a visualization.  Align it with the `fig.align` chunk option.
- Add a chunk like #2 but have the document not show the code, just the output.
- Add a chunk that *only* shows the code, but doesn't actually run.
- Add a chunk that creates an R object. Then use that object in the text via inline R code.
- Italicize or bold some words.
- Add a line break via HTML. Bonus: use <span class="pack">htmltools</span> and the `br()` function to add a line break from an R chunk.
- Set an option that will be applied to the whole document.
- Bonus: create a *.css file, to set an option for your link color.


For these, you'll have to look it up, as I haven't explicitly discussed it.

- Add a subtitle to your document
- Remove the # from the output
