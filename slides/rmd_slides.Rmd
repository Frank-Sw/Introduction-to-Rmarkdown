# Standard Documents

R Markdown files, with extension *.Rmd, are a combination of text, chunks of R code, and possibly other code or syntax, all within a single file. Various packages, e.g. rmarkdown, knitr, pandoc, etc., work behind the scenes to knit all those pieces into one coherent whole, in whatever format is desired.Pandoc is the universal translator that takes various formats, particularly markup languages, and converts them into others. The knitr package is the driving force behind most of what is done to create the final product.

# HTML

Most flexible

Displays everything as it should

Little *good* reason to use something else

---

# Text

Writing text in a R Markdown document is the same as anywhere else.  There are a couple things you'll use frequently though.

- Headers: Specified `#`, `##`, `###` etc. corresponding to H1 H2 H3 etc.
- Italics & bold:  \**word*\* for italics \*\***word**\*\* for bold.
    -  You can also use underscores (some flavors may require it).
- Links: `[some_text](http://webaddress.com)`
- Image: `![alt-text](img_location)`
- Lists: Start with a dash or number, and make sure the first element is separated from any preceding text by a full blank line. Then separate each element by a line.

---

# Code



```{r rchunk0, eval=FALSE}
x = rnorm(10)

ggplot(aes(x, y), mydata) +
  geom_point()
```

---

# Chunks

The most common thing after text is code

The code resides in a <span class="emph">chunk</span>, and looks like this


```{r rchunk, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
cat("```{r}
x = rnorm(10)
```")
```

You can add it to your document with the `Insert` menu in the upper right of your Rmd file, but as you'll be needing to do this all the time, instead you'll want to use the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl/Cmd + Alt/Option + I.

---

# In-line

R code doesn't have to be in a chunk.  You can put it right in the middle of a sentence.

```{r rinline, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
x = rnorm(10)
cat("Here is a sentence whose sum is `r 2 + 2`.")
cat("This sentence has a value of `r x[1]`.")
```

When you knit the document, it will look like ordinary text because you aren't using an R chunk:

Here is a sentence whose sum is `r 2 + 2`.

This sentence has a value of `r x[1]`.

This effect of this in scientific reporting cannot be understated.

# Be reproducible!


---

# Labels


All chunks should be given a label. 

This makes it easy to find it within your document because there are two outlines available to you. 

- One that shows your text headers (to the right)
- One that you can click to reveal that will also show your chunks (bottom left)

# Running Code

You don't have to knit the document to run the code, and often you'll be using the results as you write the document. You can run a single chunk or multiple chunks.  Use the shortcuts instead of the menu.

<img src="../img/run_chunk.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width=50%>

By default, when you knit the document all code will be run.  Depending on a variety of factors, this may or may not be what you want to do, especially if it is time-consuming to do so.  We'll talk about how to deal with this issue in the next part.

# Common Considerations

# Common Considerations

Using HTML

Chunk options

Image options

Caching

Cleaning up output

---

# Using HTML

The first thing to do is simply get used to HTML as your primary output.  
- Unless you know the document is to be printed in a traditional format

---

# Chunk options

A ridiculous number of [options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) are available to you for each chunk.  

Spend a little time to see what all is available.  

The options I commonly use are: 

- `echo`: Controls whether and how you want to *show* your code. It can be logical (TRUE/FALSE), or a numeric specifying specific line numbers.
- `eval`: Controls whether and how you want to *run* your code. It can be logical (TRUE/FALSE), or a numeric specifying specific line numbers.
- figure controls: `fig.*` `out.*` etc.

---

# Image options

R graphics (HTML vs. Others)

- `fig.width` and `fig.height` (in inches)
- `fig.width` plus `fig.asp` (height = `fig.width*fig.asp`)
- `fig.align` (no effect on interactive)
- `fig.dim` (vector of width and height values)
- `dpi` (`dpi*inches` = pixels)
- `out.width` and `out.height` (geared toward HTML-based visualization- pixels or percentages)
- `out.extra`


Markdown

- `![alt-text](img/myimage.png){width=25%}`

HTML

- `<img src="img/myimage.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">`

---

# Caching

<span class="emph">Caching</span> is both a great thing and continuous source of frustration.  First, what is it?  Caching saves the output of your R chunks into compressed files (*.RData) into a folder in the directory of your current project (or some sub-directory of your choosing).  The next time you compile the document, you don't actually have to run any code, if the code hasn't changed; it will just call the cached object.  When your document has a lot of computations, or in the spirit of reproducibility, actually runs your models, this will save a lot of time.

<img src="../img/cache.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width=50%>


---

# Cleaning up output

Several packages are available to make your R results look better.  Here's a default <span class="objclass">data.frame</span>, ugly. 

```{r dataframe}
head(mtcars)
```

One can start with <span class="pack">knitr's</span> <span class="func">kable</span> to create simple tables that look much better.
<span class="marginnote">Your tables will look a little different due to my CSS settings.</span>

```{r kable}
kable(head(mtcars))
```

---

# Cleaning up output

The <span class="pack">pander</span> package also provides more control over tables, but also can work with some model objects directly.

```{r broom_pander, out.width='50%', eval=FALSE}
lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars) %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  pander::pander(round=2, justify='lrrrr', caption='Regression results')
```

---

# Other stuff

Some other things that may be very common:
- Footnotes
- Citations and References
- Merging multiple `*.Rmd` files into a single document

# Customization and Configuration
 
---

# Output options

The basic document comes with several options to apply to your output.  

- You'll find a cog wheel in the toolbar area underneath the tabs.

<!-- something is broken here so leave empty -->

---

# Themes etc.

As a first step, simply play around with the <span class="emph">themes</span> you already have available.  

Choosing one of these will make your document look good without breaking a sweat.

<img src="../img/theme_dropdown.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width='50%'>

---

# Themes etc.

For many of the documents you create, changing the defaults this way may be enough. So be familiar with your options.  

After making your selections, now see what has changed at the top of your document.  You might see something like the following.

<img src="../img/selected_options.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width='50%'>


---

# YAML

For the purposes of starting out, all you really need to know is that YAML is like configuration code for your document.  You can see that it specifies what the output is, and whatever options you selected previously.  You can change the title, add a date etc.  There is a lot of other stuff too.  Here is the YAML for this document.

# HTML & CSS


Basic stuff can go a long way.

---

## HTML

Knowing some basic HTML can add little things to your document to make it look better.

## CSS


Recall the style section in some of the HTML examples above. For example, the part `style='color:#66023C; font-size:150%; font-weight:600'` changed the font.  <span class="marginnote"> **CSS** stands for **c**ascading **s**tyle **s**heets</span>It's actually CSS, and if we need to do the same thing each time, we can take an alternative approach to creating a style that would apply the same settings to all objects of the same class or HTML tag throughout the document.

The first step is to create a `*.css` file that your R Markdown document can refer to. 

---

# Personal Templates

A common mantra in computer programming and beyond is DRY, or Don't Repeat Yourself.  If you start using R Markdown a lot, and there is a good chance of that, once you get some settings you use often, you'll not want to start from scratch, but simply reuse them.  While this can be done [formally](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_document_templates.html) by creating an R package, it can also be as simple as saving a file that just has the YAML and maybe some <span class="pack">knitr</span> options specified, and starting from that file each time.  Same goes for CSS or other files you use often. 

Over time, these files and settings will grow, especially as you learn new options and want to tweak old.  In the end, you may have very little to do to make the document look great the first time you knit it!

---

# The Rabbit Hole Goes Deep

How much you want to get into customization is up to you.  Using the developer tools of any web browser allows you to inspect what anyone else has done as far as styling with CSS.  Here is an example of Chrome Developer Tools, which you can access through its menus.

# Comparison to Alternatives

---

# PDF & LaTeX

$\LaTeX$ was the gold-standard for scientific reporting for a long time



---

# MS Word

MS Word is sadly still required by journals that have not kept up with the times

It seems easy to use
- until you want to stray from defaults

While it has some nice features, these are all met or actually better implemented via other means
