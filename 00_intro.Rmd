# Introduction

<span class="emph">R Markdown</span> is a flavor of Markdown, a markup language.  Markdown can be converted to other formats like HTML, but is as easy to use as normal text editing. R Markdown allows one to combine normal R code with text to produce a wide variety of document formats.  This allows for a continuous transition from initial data import and processing to a finished product, whether journal article, slide presentation, or even a website.


## Goals

The goal is for you to be able to get started with your own document, and understand the possibilities available to you.  You will get a feel for the basic mechanics at play, as well as have ideas on how to customize the result to your own tastes.  You should also understand it well enough to use it for your next paper/project/whatever.


## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is a basic understanding of R.  Much of the R code in the document won't be dwelt upon or really explained, as what the code does won't matter in many contexts.  This is definitely not a place where you will learn how to program in R or do statistics with it.

Note the following color coding used in this document:

- <span class="emph">emphasis</span>
- <span class="pack">package</span>
- <span class="func">function</span>
- <span class="objclass">object/class</span>
- [link]()


## Note

This document is created with R Markdown via the <span class="pack">bookdown</span> package.
