# Appendix

## Footnotes

Footnotes are very straightforward.  To add one just put `[^myfootnote]` where needed (the name is arbitrary) then, somewhere in your document add the following.

```markdown
[^myfootnote]:  Yadda blah yadda.
```

The usual practice is to put them at the end of the document.  It doesn't matter what order you put them in, they will be displayed/numbered as they appear in the actual text.

## Citations and References


### References & Bibliography

Assuming you have a reference file somewhere adding them to the text of the document is very easy.  Many formats of the file are acceptable, such as BibTeX, EndNote, and more.  For example if using BibTeX and the file is `refs.bib`, then just note the file in the YAML section.

```yaml
bibliography: refs.bib
biblio-style: apalike
link-citations: yes
```

The style can be anything you want, but will take some extra steps to use.  Consult the R Markdown page.

Now, somewhere in your document, put an empty References header like so:

```markdown
# References
```

The references you cite will magically appear in the references section when you knit the document.

### Citations

Now that your document has some references


Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].

A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text:

Smith says blah [-@smith04].

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

@smith04 says blah.

@smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
