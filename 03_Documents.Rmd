# Standard Documents

## R Markdown files

R Markdown files, with extension `*.Rmd`, are a combination of text, <span class="emph">chunks</span> of R code, and possibly other code within a single document. Various packages, e.g. rmarkdown, knitr, pandoc, etc., work behind the scenes to knit all those pieces into one coherent whole, in whatever format is desired.<span class="marginnote">Pandoc is the universal translator that takes various formats, particularly markup languages, and converts them into others.</span>

### HTML

I personally do everything in HTML because it's the most flexible and easiest to get things looking the way you want.  Presumably at some point these will simply be the default that people both use and expect in the academic realm, as there is little additional value that one can get with PDF or MS Word, and often notably less.  Furthermore, academia is an anachronism.  How much do you use PDF and Word for *anything* else relative to HTML?


## Text

Writing text in a R Markdown document is the same as anywhere else.  There are a couple things you'll use frequently though.

- Headers: Specified #, ##, ### etc. corresponding to H1 H2 H3 etc.
- Italics & bold:  \*word*\ for italics \*\*word\*\* for bold.  You can also use underscores for bold.
- Lists: Start with a - or 1. and make sure the first element is separated from preceding text by a full blank line. Then separate each element by a line.

```
Some *text*.

- List item 1
- List item 2
```

That will pretty much cover most of your text needs.  For those that know HTML & CSS, you can use those throughout the text as you desire as well.  For example, sometimes I need some extra space after a plot and will put in a `<br>`.

## Code
### Chunks

After text, the most common thing you'll have is code.  The code resides in a <span class="emph">chunk</span>, and looks like this.

```{r rchunk, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
cat("```{r}
x = rnorm(10)
```")
```

There is no limit to what you put in an R chunk.  I don't recommend it, but it could be hundreds of lines of code.  You can put these anywhere within the document.

### In-line

R code doesn't have to be in a chunk.  You can put it right in the middle of a sentence.

```{r rinline, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
x = rnorm(10)
cat("Here is a sentence whose sum is `r 2 + 2`.")
cat("This sentence has a value of `r x[1]`.")
```

When you knit the document it will look like ordinary text because you aren't using an R chunk:

Here is a sentence whose sum is `r 2 + 2`.

This sentence has a value of `r x[1]`.

This effect of this in scientific reporting cannot be understated.  ***Your goal in writing a document should be to not explicitly write a single number!***

### Labels

All chunks should be given a label. This makes it easy to fine within your document because there are two outlines available to you. One that shows your text headers (to the right), and one that you can click to reveal that will also show your chunks (bottom left).  If they just say Chunk 1, Chunk 2 etc., it doesn't help you any.  There is also some potential benefit in terms of caching, which we'll discuss later.

### Running code

You don't have to knit the document to run the code, and often you'll be using the results as you write the document. You can run a single chunk or multiple chunks.  Use the shortcuts instead of the menu.

By default, when you knit the document all code will be run.  Depending on a variety of factors, this may or may not be what you want to do, especially if it is time-consuming toa do so.  We'll talk about how to deal with this issue in the next section.

## Multiple documents

A single `.Rmd` file can call others, referred to as <span class="emph">child documents</span>, and when you knit that document you'll have one single document with the content from all of them.  You may want to consider other formats, such as <span class="emph">bookdown</span>, rather than doing this.  Unnecessary scrolling is what bad web-designers make you do, and not actually required for the presentation of material.  It also makes the content take longer to load, because everything has to load[^preload].


## Collaboration

R Notebooks are a format one can use that might be more suitable for collaboration.  They are identical to the standard HTML document in most respects, but chunks will by default print output in the Rmd file itself.  For example, a graduate student could write up a notebook, and their advisor could then 


[^preload]: There is not yet a way within R Markdown that I'm aware of to load on demand as many websites do.  However, waiting for things to load until you come to them is annoying at best, and I personally get tired of waiting and move on to other things.
